	Abstract = {This report gives the 2014 self-consistent set of values of the constants and conversion factors of physics and chemistry recommended by the Committee on Data for Science and Technology ( CODATA ). These values are based on a least-squares adjustment that takes into account all data available up to 31 December 2014 . The recommended values may also be found on the World Wide Web at physics.nist.gov/ constants .},
